# Hello

My name is Edison, I am currently in my 3rd year at Simon Fraser University, majoring in Health Science and pursuing Computer Science activities whenever available.

## Current Projects
[SFU Cycling Club](https://sfu-biking-club.vercel.app/) - a web application to assist club members and executives in communication and route planning. Members may suggest cycling routes, and executives can plan accordingly as they may.

[Course Compass](https://course-compass-dun.vercel.app/) - a university degree planner focused on, having course selection less of a hassle and making the most out of time there.
